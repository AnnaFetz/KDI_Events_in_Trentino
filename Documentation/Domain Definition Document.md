# Project domain
The project's scope, meaning its Domain of Interest, intersects the Event domain with the University Student Life within Trentino's area. Due to the placement of University of Trento's departments, the spatial coverage includes only the municipalities of Trento and Rovereto. Furthermore, the project targets the period from 2019 to 2022. This wide time span aims at detecting and modeling the changes that occurred due to the Covid-19 pandemic in event organization and participation. The final deliverable should correspond to a website acting as a collective memory of a specific administrative area. The target users are university students who interact with the service as short-term memory (i.e., working memory) and long-term memory, specifically episodic. While the former function filters the future events by location, duration, target age, personal interests, event category (e.g., music, shows, festivals), and secondary attributes (e.g., language, price), the latter retrieves relevant information about past events. This option focuses mainly on the event's description, tags, ranking, comments, and pictures.
# Purpose
A service that responds to specific event requests performed by a (future) student of the University of Trento, within the age range 18-30 and interested in events in the municipalities of Trento and Rovereto.

|Giovanni|19|politics, enterprises, social life, economics|query upcoming events|Giovanni moved to Trento at the beginning of October to start his bachelor's in Economics. Everything is new, and he knows the importance of making friends at the university and, if possible, also outside. One evening, he decides to search for upcoming musical events that gather many people and do not cost too much. This may be a practical solution for the immediate loneliness, but he wants to be involved in more extended activities too. Thus, he wants to find out which student associations are involved in politics and, possibly, also in economics.|
|Martina|19|law, popular events, happy hour|- list the most popular bars in Trento  - retrieve events extra information |Even if freshman, Martina shows excellent social skills. She has already organized an Aperitif with her new colleagues but the location is undefined yet. She plans to find the best bar in the city center by ranking them based on the last two events and the extra benefits offered during those occasions. She also wants to convince her colleagues to go to the Poplarfestival, a famous music festival in Trento. Price, online booking, and Covid restrictions are the relevant information she should give them.|
|Arianna|20|biology, medical engineering |find out the upcoming events related to her field of interest|Arianna finds her courses extremely theoretical and is deeply unsure about her choice. She loves biology but would like to see the practical projects and their results in the medical engineering field. Even though her professors are well referenced, she is interested in something more. Interviews, seminars, and lectures held by (international) guests are her passion. Sometimes she also tries to contact the lecturers or the event organizers to ask for further information about the topics.|
|Simon|24|sport|retrieve matches and filter them on user requirements  |Simon is a sports fan. Independently from the sport, they try to watch as many matches as possible. Before the Covid pandemic, they went to some matches of the city's basketball team: L'Aquila Trento. This year they want to discover new (Paralympic) sports, such as Hokey and Volleyball, hoping for affordable prices, starting at reasonable hours, and are in places reachable by bus.|
|Clara|26|cognitive science, volunteering, religion, art |filter events based on their topic, location and distance from a point (i.e., train station) |Clara has a busy routine. Due to the constraints posed by lectures and train timetables, she struggles to find activities parallel to the university. Specifically, she looks for art workshops providing the necessary material, preferably free and not far from the train station. Knowing that the probability of finding such an event in Rovereto is extremely low, she also looks for spiritual associations or groups organizing volunteering activities and meetings.|
|Timon|23|knowing other cultures |search for events organized by specific organizations (i.e., ESN) targeting international students |Most of his colleagues are Italian-only speakers, knowing little English. This makes him feel like an outcast. Therefore, days pass by slowly without having a real chance of integrating and getting to know different cultures better. He decides to turn things upside down and start living the pure Erasmus experience by finding the next ESN events, and related activities.|
|Paola|25|photography, history, art|filter events by accessibility|Although having lived in Trento for many years, Paola has never had the chance of sightseeing. Therefore, one day she spontaneously decides to visit the city and a new photography gallery that just opened in the center. However, she discovers that steps are the primary way to get there, and nobody seems to know whether there are impaired-suited entrances. After this experience, she decided to map the city events to determine whether they are accessible, provide specific offers for people with disabilities, and provide reserved parking lots.|
|Davide|28|hiking, food, engineering |-retrieve events requiring certain skills  - filter events within a time-span|Due to organizational issues, Davide's friends decided to cancel the hiking excursion, which had been planned for weeks. However, Davide has already prepared everything for a nice weekend in the mountains. He now wants to check whether any trekking group in the city is organizing similar events on the weekend. By tag, he would like to retrieve hiking experiences during the weekend and require medium skills. If the search will not return results, he would also be open to taking advantage of the free weekend by attending seminars that could boost his career.|
|Daniel|18|music, chess|retrieve past events archive (comments, pictures, results)|Daniel has thought out the choice of the university, but he is still skeptical. One last parameter is left out: social life. He focuses on two aspects: musical events and chess. Firstly, he retrieves musical events and festivals based on friends' advice. He wants to judge them by reading comments, looking at pictures of past editions, and evaluating the overall offer. Secondly, he searches for recent achievements and competitions of the universityÂ´s chess club. Alternatively, if there is none, similar activities are organized by private clubs or student associations.|
|Andrea|26|music, performing art|reserve seats for an event based on location and price |Besides the pure passion for music, Andrea fell in love with someone and would like to make a great impression on their first date. Therefore, after having carefully scrutinized their Social Media profile, the decision lands over assisting at the concert of their crush's favorite musician. They would like to pay for the best available seats, in the best location possible, according to the price range.|
