* Domain Definition Document: description of all personas and scenarios 

* Project Report: the final report of the project with the description of each phase and choice 

* Project Presentation: the presentation presented at the end of the course to summarize the final model 

* Conversion document: an additional folder containing two tables referring to the OpenDATA Trentino dataset about [accessibility](http://www.contextaware.provincia.tn.it/PortaleCxA/faces/openData.jsp). The first table is the original form used to gather data (from [HandiCREA](https://www.handicrea.it) cooperative), and the other describes the codes and their meaning.
