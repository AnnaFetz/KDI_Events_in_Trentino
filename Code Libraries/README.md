This folder collects all the code libraries produced and adopted during the iTelos procedure to manage data and knowledge resources.
(i.e., Python libraries, Shell scripts, Javascript, etc.)

All scripts (and final datasets) have been collected and updated in a different repository for easier understanding. It is public and reachable at this link:
[KDI-project](https://github.com/LuciaHrovatin/KDI_project/tree/main/Formatted_Datasets).
